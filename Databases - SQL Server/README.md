# Databases - SQL Server

For the Databases Design course, I did a project with the **SQLServer DBMS**, on a local database. 
## Part 1 : Indexes
Firstly, I created the **LIBRARY** database locally. Then, I had to do several exercises on this database, including **writing queries**, and collecting statistics to **create indexes**, to make the queries run faster. The first part is in the file Indexes/QueriesIndexes.sql.
## Part 2 : Data Warehouse
For this part a had to create a **star schema** Data Warehouse. The warehouse is storing selected data from the **LIBRARY** database, in order to execute queries for collecting statistics much faster. I also had to create a data cube in 2 ways.
