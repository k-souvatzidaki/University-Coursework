# MIPS32 Assembly

For the Computer Systems Organization course, I did 2 assignments in Assembly.
The first one, a program that given two integers as input, it calculates their **greatest common divisor**.
The second one was a bit more complex. It's a program that lets the user choose between different actions on sparse integer arrays. Each action is implemented in a **function**.
