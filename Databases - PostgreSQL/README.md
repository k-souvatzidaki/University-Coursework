# Databases: PostgreSQL - Amazon AWS database

For the Databases course we created a database with AirBnb data on the Amazon AWS cloud platform. We then did several exercises, including **applying changes to the schema, writing queries, creating indexes etc**.
We also did a bigger project in both SQL and **Python** , where we manipulated CSV files and made changes to the database. We also added some Zillow data. This was our first time writing SQL and creating a database schema from scratch.

## Datasets
Unfortunately, I couldn't find the datasets we used for this project.. (it's been a while).

## 3. Altering the database schema

## 4. Splitting columns and creating new tables

## 5. Writing GROUP BY queries (aggregations)
