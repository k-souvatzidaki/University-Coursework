# Negative filter on PPM images with C++

The objective of this assignment is to read a .ppm format image as a binary file (**ppm.cpp**), and to create an **Image** object, that being an array of **Color** RGB values. 
Then, we apply a negative filter to the image by manipulating the colour RGB values/pixels one by one (**neg.cpp**). It was a good way to understand how pointers work in C++, 
and become more familiar with how files are stored in a computer. Seems like an easy task, but it was a big challenge for the beginner I used to be in programming back then.
